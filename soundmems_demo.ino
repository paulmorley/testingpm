Now with FIFTEEN, YES, FIFTEEN 1D sound reactive routines. Some look similar to the others, so I've spread them out.

These sound reactive program does not use FFT or an MSGEQ7 chip, but rather just uses the current sample, the average (of the last 64 samples) and peak detection.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

The Sparkfun MEMS microphone I use SHOULD be powered with 3.3V. If you do so, you need to connect the 3.3V pin on the Arduino to the AREF pin on your Arduino.

Furthermore, you will need to uncommment the following line in setup:

//  analogReference(EXTERNAL);                                                    // Comment out this line for 3.3V Arduino's, ie. Flora, etc.

If you power your microphone from 5V or are using a 3.3V Arduino, such as a Flora, etc, then leave the line commented out.



Features:

- 10^h^h15, count 'em 10^h^h15 different awesome sound reactive display routines.
- Broken out functionality into separate .h files for readability.
- Only ONE delay statement in the setup. That's it. Delay statements have no place in the loop.
- Uses a variable rate EVERY_N_MILLISI() function instead.
- Trying to localize and tighten up the variable definitions as much as possible.
- Uses the 3.3V Sparkfun MEMS microphone with a whopping 67 dba gain.
- Uses a potentiometer to adjust sensitivity.
- Uses FastLED palettes, palette transitioning, beats, fading, fast math as well as perlin noise functionality.
- No floating point math. I use 8 or 16 bit for better performance.
- Shows that you don't need gobs of code to come up with a cool display sequence.


Not features:

- Not object oriented.
- Not passing variables or structs to/from functions.
- Sorry, but I prefer Java style curly brackets and not C style. Maybe that's because I don't use a real IDE and I'm not a real programmer.
- This probably won't scale beyond 255 LED's. I'll leave that job up to you.


Notes:

- This comes preconfigured for 60 APA102 LED's and a 3.3V Sparkfun MEMS microphone. Reconfigure and compile this for your own environment.
- Comment the analogreference(EXTERNAL) line if using a 3.3V Arduino OR a 5V microphone.
- This requires a potentiometer to adjust sensitivity. I use a linear 10K.
- This runs at about 430 loops per second on an Arduino Nano with 60 APA102's. If you add routines, do NOT add delay statements or I will find you, and . . .
